# PLACY-transmission-design
Design of a gearbox with a module 1 planetary reducer built inside a generic cycloidal stage's shaft.
The repository contain the files of two reducers (one with a classical cycloidal stage, one with a compact-cam stage) and an executable tool for the geometric design of gearboxes based on this architecture. Also, the source python code is given for custom implementations of the design tool, or for setting up optimization processed for this design.
