# PLACY-transmission-design
Design of a gearbox with a low-module planetary reducer built inside a generic cycloidal stage's shaft.
The repository contain the executable tool for the geometric design of gearboxes based on this architecture (PLACYd and PLACYc). Also, the source python code is given for custom implementations of the design tool, or for setting up optimization processed for this design. The CAD files are available upn request
